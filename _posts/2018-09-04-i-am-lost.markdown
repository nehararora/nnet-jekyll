I am lost, tired, and adrift, in a world filled with hate <br>
And for now it feels like I'm out of defiance. <br>
And I'm losing, I'm losing, I'm losing <br>
That beautiful dawn I used to believe in, <br>
And I don't know what to do. <br>
I don't know what to do love, <br>
And I don't remember the words - <br>
words that brought faith, <br>
words that once could heal. <br>
With a tired faith and lost words, <br>
I don't know how to remember anymore <br>
and I'm forgetting how to keep the covenant. <br>
