And you write in blood, <br>
and you write in blood, <br>
ant you write in blood, <br>
songs that are long dead and gone. <br>
<br>
By the edge of fear, <br>
on the edge of fear, <br>
On the edge of a rhyme long gone. <br>
On the edge of a love long gone. <br>
<br>
We were as gods, <br>
we were as gods, <br>
we were as gods <br>
with the breath of our soul long gone. <br>
The light of our soul long gone. <br>
<br>
It's made of trust <br>
it's made of trust, <br>
it's made of trust - <br>
This need for truth long gone. <br>
This need to run long gone. <br>
<br>
And the brave will die, <br>
and the good will die, <br>
With the gift of dust all gone. <br>
When all the dust is gone. <br>
<br>
They say you believed, <br>
they say you foresaw <br>
you knew it would all be gone. <br>
Before the foretelling was gone <br>
before the innocence was gone. <br>

It's all the same <br>
It's all the same <br>
you can taste the truth long gone <br>
the taint of dust long gone. <br>
The time is long long gone. <br>
<br>
It's all good, It's all fine <br>
we fucked up the tune <br>
we missed the beat <br>
otherwise was a hell of a song. <br>
