It's far under the old, old sun, <br>
there is a heart to the heat. <br>
Dust blooming like flowers of mist. <br>
There is memory here, <br>
and a tightening of breath. <br>
And serrated edges that focus on the horizon... <br>
... or point at the past - <br>
it's always hard to tell. <br>
The day seems shorter still. <br>
Somehow... Constricted at the pith. <br>
There is truth to be found here - or so they say. <br>
Maybe. There is a rightness to the thought. <br>
After all, there is a feel of something... <br>
at the edges - always at the edges. <br>
Never mind. <br>
This is what I choose to remain. <br>
This and nothing more. <br>
