In this liquid world, <br>
In this fluid, fluid, fluid world <br>
How do I remember to run and breathe at the same time. <br> 
Run, run, run while the minutes drain through <br>
Mine and yours, darkness claims its piece of flesh. <br> 
I raise my hand - and my armies rise <br>
I raise my hands - and the blood tide rises <br>
In this crumbling place, in this tiny narrow place <br>
In this mean small space. <br>

  _Remember this._ <br>
I raise my hands <br>
  _Remember this_ <br>
I raise my head <br>
  _Remember this_ <br>
I raise my eyes <br>
  _Remember this_ <br>
look up at the sky <br>
Remember this - before the breath slips away. <br> 

There were those of us who thought of this <br>
There were those of us who remembered this <br>
In this liquid world <br>
In this fluid, fluid, fluid world <br>
Breathe and run, breathe and run, breathe and run <br>
How do I remember to breathe and run at the same damn time <br>
On this spinning, rocking world <br>
The divine slips away as we run and breathe, <br> 
run and breathe, <br>
run and breathe, <br>
run and breathe, <br>
one last damn time. <br>
