In some slow time, <br>
and another deeper space, <br>
I could be bigger than this... <br>
I would be - more unfathomable. <br>
A broader river winds through  <br>
the woods, <br>
and I would follow if I could <br> 
The brighter starlight that falls - <br>
if only I could see it as I should.

While all the truth that I can muster waits <br>
expectant... lingering... in the silence, <br>
the slowed time passes... <br>
...and the  wider spaces shrink. <br>
