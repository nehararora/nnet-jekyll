In this mad spinning world <br>
You - you are the immovable center <br> 
Anchoring my reality <br>
With your very being, shaping the fiber of mine. <br> 
I know of the impermanence of life <br>
The triviality of existence <br>
But in theses few moments of peace <br> 
I can feel the shape of eternities. <br>
